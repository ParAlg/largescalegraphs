# Workshop on Large-Scale Graph Processing (SPAA 2022)

Quickly processing very large graphs containing billions to trillions of vertices and edges is increasingly important in practice today. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers studying theoretical and practical aspects of large-scale parallel graph processing to share their results on new problems, models, and algorithms, and to share progress in translating theoretical results to practical large-scale graph processing solutions.

Some topics that will be covered include industrial applications of parallel graph processing, frameworks for graph processing, representations of dynamic graphs, parallel graph-clustering, theoretically-efficient graph algorithms, and parallel graph partitioning.

The workshop will take place on Monday, July 11th from 1--5pm. Please
see the [SPAA site][spaa] for more details.
